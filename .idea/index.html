<b>12/15</b>
<br><br>Built website using html and css to keep track of accomplishments and progress! This is my first personal project soooo :'D
<br><br>Immediate interests: machine learning, algorithms, and data structures :D
<br><br>Future interests: learn python and create a stock prices predictor. Things to research - predictive analysis, regression analysis, action analysis, statistical modeling.
<br><br>Learned <a href = "https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/" target = "blank" class="link">binary trees</a>
- preorder, inorder, postorder, level-order

<br><br><hr>

<br><b>12/16</b>
<br><br>Data structure learning order: Arrays, Lists, Stack, Queue, Heap, Hash Table, Trees, Graphs, Maps
<br><br>C++ book and machine learning book came in today.
<br><br>Learned about linked lists, I can successfully <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/" target = "blank" class="link">reverse a linked list</a> :'D
<br><br><hr>

<br><b>12/17</b>
<br><br>Solved leetcode problem on <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/" target = "blank" class="link">Palindromes</a>. Angela gave an amazing int to String solution!
<br><br>More ideas, create a website where "users" can go online shopping for their favorite foods, snake game, mini arcade.
<br><br><hr>

<br><b>12/18</b>
<br><br>Created an amazing <a href = "snakegame.html" target = "blank" class = "link">snake game</a> using javascript and html (located in coding projects too :D) Planning on using this to create an AI for this game.
<br><br>Learned that to run javascript, you need to host servers locally (took 2 hours lol). Thankfully vscode has that feature so now I am using that as my IDE.
<br><br>Solved leetcode problem on <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/" target = "blank" class="link">Plus One</a> using arrays.

<br><br>Attemped leetcode problem on <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/" target = "blank" class="link">Roman to Integer</a> using arrays. I kinda solved it, but ther is a faster solution using hash tables. I will look into this at another time.

<br><br>Attemped leetcode problem on <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/" target = "blank" class="link">Merging Sorted Arrays</a>.
<br><br>Solved leetcode problem on <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/" target = "blank" class="link">Roman to Integer</a>. Hash Table solution was faster but I haven't learned that yet so I used simple arrays.

<br><b>12/21</b>
<br><br>Started a minesweeper project in python with a friend in the cmu cs academy website. Hopefully we finish in two days.
<br><br><hr>

<br><b>12/22</b>
<br><br>Continued minesweeper project. Grid, start screen, and bomb placement is finalized but we are having trouble with the clicking.
<br><br><hr>

<br><b>3/20</b>
<br><br> Started data structures and algorithms.
<br><br> Moved to github...will post more stuff there
